Ever seen a truly *fearless* person?  If so, you're likely one of the few people
on earth who have.

Truly fearless people are incredibly rare.  Having the courage, willpower, and
dedication to your goals to face them without fear is something that not many
people are willing to do.  Being able to crush whatever obstacles are in your
way (regardless of how large and imposing they are) is an *almost*
insurmountable task -- for anyone.

Life will constantly throw obstacles into your path -- how will you react to
them?

In today's world, you grow up being taught *how to fear*:

- You must obey all the arbitrary laws imposed by the government under which you
  were born.
- You must go to school, and force yourself to perform to a certain level or
  else you'll face the wrath of parents, teachers, and society.
- You must take these pills to stay healthy, or else fear that you'll get
  whichever disease is most talked about at this point in time.
- You must keep quiet about things that you *know* are wrong, otherwise you'll
  face punishment by society.

There's truly a never ending list of fears that modern society instills in you
from birth.  Is it all planned?  One big conspiracy to keep the average person
living in a bubble?  *Of course not*, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening.

The average person will grow up with such a fear-based view of the world that
it's incredible anyone ever breaks out of the mold at all.

I've been mulling this over for the past several years -- what is life about,
anyway?  Why must we (as individuals) live to a certain standard?  Why can't we
make our own decisions and live freely without worrying what other people will
think of us?

Allowing yourself to be held back by your fears is an incredibly draining thing.
If you constantly question your thoughts and actions, instead of living the life
you want to live, you'll end up living a life you've been *forced to live*.

There's nobody out there fighting for you except you.  Nobody will tell you that
you need to start living your life the way you want to.  It's all up to you.

Instead of making decisions based on your fears, maybe it's time you decide who
you want to be.  Not what you want to be like, but *who you want to be*.  When
you decide *who* you want to be, don't sell yourself short.  Give it everything
you've got.

If you're 300lbs overweight and want to become a bodybuilder, the only person
holding you back is *you*.  Don't be afraid of what other people think -- get
out there, and do whatever needs to be done to reach your goals.  It's going to
be hard work.  People are going to say all sorts of things.  But do you want to
continue living your life the way it is -- wanting more, but being too afraid to
chase after your dreams?  Or do you want to suck it up, say *fuck it*, and fight
your way to the top?  Which will it be?

You've only got one life to live.  You might as well live fully and die knowing
you've stayed true to yourself and your ambitions.  I know that I'd be able to
die in peace knowing that I didn't care about the rest of the world and spent
all of my effort doing what *I think* is right, regardless of what others think.
