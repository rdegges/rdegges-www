While I'm not one to advocate many personal development *hacks*, there is one
hack that I think everyone dedicated to personal growth and success should know
about: *have high standards for yourself*.

Unlike many of the other hacks you may read about, having high personal
standards will almost immediately force personal growth, and will help you live
up to your potential day after day -- it's also *really simple* to execute.


## Be Ruthless With Yourself

If you're anything like me, although you enjoy improving yourself (mentally,
physically, whatever), you probably view yourself as a work in progress, and as
such, don't think very highly of yourself.

While being humble is certainly a great trait, it's often misused.  Simply
being humble and viewing yourself in a negative light won't help you achieve
personal growth -- if anything, it will slow your development.

By constantly thinking down on yourself, you're conditioning yourself to accept
lower standards and mediocrity -- the exact opposite of what you want to
accomplish.  If you'd like to become a better person, you need to constantly
push yourself to achieve more, behave better, and learn to consistently
outperform past versions of yourself.

One fool-proof way to aggressively pursue personal growth is to hold yourself
to a high set of personal standards -- then ruthlessly strive to live up to
your own expectations.

As you continue to strive towards your high personal standards, you'll make
quick gains that would have come slowly otherwise.  I've found that when I'm
under pressure (from myself) to act or live up to a certain standard, it's much
easier for me to accomplish my goals.


## Developing Standards

If you've never formally listed what your personal goals are, you should take a
few minutes to do so now.  Create a Google doc named *Growth*, and make a list
of the following:

-   Traits you'd ideally like to have.
-   Ways you'd like to behave.
-   People who you respect.

For instance, if you'd like to always live up to your word, you may want to
write something along the lines of:

-   Honor my commitments, regardless of external factors.
-   Carefully think things through before agreeing to do things.

Or, if you'd like to improve in a more physical way, set specific (and
difficult to reach) goals:

-   Have 20-inch biceps, 40-inch quads, and 60-inch chest measurements.
-   Run a mile in 5 minutes flat.
-   Squat 1,000 lbs.

By clearly stating your goals and ideal behaviors, you set a clear precedent
for yourself to follow and live up to.  From this point on, refer to your list
frequently to remind yourself what you're aiming to accomplish, and why it
matters to you.

**NOTE**: Keeping a list of people who inspire you, and who you respect, is
important because it motivates you to be more like those people you look up to
so much.


## Respect Yourself

Once you've clearly defined the person you want to become, working towards your
ideal self becomes that much easier.  Respect yourself for striving to reach
difficult goals, and think highly of yourself as you work to better yourself.

Having respect for yourself makes it easier for you to make difficult decisions.
We're all defined by our actions, and those of us who have precise, measurable
goals and a sufficient quantity of self respect can more easily make the tough
decisions that either push us forward or pull us back.

What will you do when you're sitting at a restaurant with your friends and
you're offered that sweet (by unhealthy) dessert?  Will you eat it?  Is that
what you'd ideally do?  What would future you do in this situation?  Which
decision will push you further towards your ideal self?

Set high standards, ruthlessly pursue your goals, and respect yourself.

Achieve great things, my friends.
