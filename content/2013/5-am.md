![Luffy Sketch][]


All my life, I've been the sort of person that likes to sleep until 2pm, then
wake up and do things.  For as long as I can remember, I've been more *awake*
and active at night than during the day.

Being awake at night just feels *natural* to me.  It always has.

Starting two weeks back, I decided to change things up a bit, and try something
new.  Instead of waking up at 1 or 2pm each day, I made a commitment to myself
that for a month I'd wake up at 5am, Monday through Friday.

But that's not all.

On top of that, I made a new schedule for myself as well.  While I normally
don't stick to any formal *schedules*, I decided that in an attempt to force
myself out of my comfort zone (and become a more awesome dude), I'd push myself
extra hard this month by following a strict schedule, and maintaining an intense
daily routine.

I'd like to use this opportunity to chronicle my experiences so far, so that I
have something to look back on in the coming months.


## Why Do This?

I have a somewhat freaky obsession with personal development.  The idea of
improving oneself both physically and mentally really appeal to me.

To that end, I'm constantly trying new things to up my game.  I lift a lot of
weights, diet hard, focus intently, and try to be as effective as possible with
my work and fun projects.

All that aside, one of the few things I haven't seriously tried over the years
has been forcing myself to stick to a strict schedule.  Maybe it's my almost
*hilariously* nonconformist attitude about everything, but the very idea of a
structured, scheduled day seems like an incredibly dull way to live.

When I think about working a typical 9 to 5 job, my brain seems melt a little
(luckily, I work for a [company][] I co-own, which is pretty great).

Anyhow, back to the point.  I decided that since I haven't seriously tried
maintaining a strict schedule, this would be an excellent way to force myself
to try something new, get uncomfortable, and (hopefully) advance myself.

At the very least, my goal for this experiment is to measure my productivity
over a decent length of time, and see:

-   How well I can hold up to a schedule.
-   How much I can produce (in terms of both work and personal projects).
-   If I'm able to successfully balance my existing commitments and life with my
    new schedule (I'm married, after all).

To help me kick start my new schedule and give myself the highest odds of
success, I also decided to flip my sleep schedule around.  My reasoning here was
that since I normally wake up in the afternoon (and have lots of work email /
phone calls to deal with), forcing myself to wake up early *AND* maintain a new
schedule would allow me to squeeze a lot more out of my days by giving myself
plenty of uninterrupted time in the mornings to focus on my new schedule and get
as much done as possible.


## Getting Into the New Schedule

The first problem I had was forcing myself to bed early enough so that I could
wake up at 5am reasonably well.  Since I planned this all out, and, knowing
myself, realized it would be nearly impossible to force myself to bed at 8pm
each night -- I decided to cheat: *I took a sleeping pill*.

The night before I started my new experiment, I took a sleeping pill at ~6:30pm,
and eventually crawled into bed around 7:30pm and fell asleep by 8, leaving me
with a solid 9 hours of rest so I'd be fresh for the first day.

**NOTE**: The sleeping pill method actually worked really well for me.  Those
things are pretty damn strong, and my first day into the new schedule was really
easy to get through since I was fully rested.  Occasionally (through the next
two weeks) I took another sleeping pill to help myself get to bed early (my
internal clock seems to force me to bed later and later every night).

In terms of my days (I only planned Monday through Friday, I left Saturday and
Sunday open as free days), I decided to structure them as you can see below:

- **5:00am - 5:30am** Wake up.
- **5:30am - 7:00am** Go to the gym, lift weights, and do some stair master
  afterwards.
- **7:00am - 7:30am** Breakfast and reading.
- **7:30am - 8:30am** Two pomodoro worth of personal projects.
- **8:30am - 9:30am** Break (relax, write, read, whatever).
- **9:30am - 1:30pm** Do work (in pomodoro).
- **1:30pm - 2:30pm** Lunch break!
- **2:30pm - 4:30pm** Do work (in pomodoro).
- **4:30pm - bed** Free time.

As you can see above, the proposed schedule leaves me with a solid 6 hours of
uninterrupted work each day (that's a lot of programming time), a full hour of
personal project time, and plenty of free time.

**NOTE**: If you have no idea what a pomodoro is, don't feel bad.  It's
essentially a 25 minute block of time where you intently focus on a single task
without distraction.  If you've never read the book [The Pomodoro Technique][],
you should -- it's awesome.


### Gym

Getting into the groove for my new gym routine wasn't hard at all.  Before
starting this experiment, I was already used to going to the gym immediately
after waking up (with the exception of occasionally answering important work
email first).

Since I started waking up early, I haven't checked my work email at all in the
morning, so it's been really easy to jump out of bed, brush my teeth, chug a
protein shake, and head out to the gym.


### Personal Projects

Working on my personal projects after the gym has been easy and fun.  I love
working on side projects, they keep me happy and make me feel productive --
spending an hour on them in the morning has been great.

Previously, I found it really difficult to squeeze time into my day to work on
fun projects.  It is way too easy to wake up late in the day, and immediately be
bogged down by work email, urgent phone calls, and all other sorts of madness.

The way you start your day also really affects how awesome (or shitty) your day
is going to be.  I've had plenty of days where as soon as I wake up I'm
inundated with phone calls and emergencies.  It's really easy to let stressful
mornings like that ruin the rest of your day, and it's happened to me way too
much.

Getting an early start and having plenty of uninterrupted time to hack on my
personal projects always gets me into a great mood.  By the time I actually
start my work later in the day, I've already:

- Gone to the gym and gotten in a good workout.
- Worked on something important to me personally, and made good progress.
- Had a bit of time to relax, read, write, and spend some quiet time alone.

So far, my hour of personal project time every morning has become the most
cherished part of my new schedule, and has really made a huge difference in my
day to day happiness.


### Work

Before starting this experiment, my work schedule was usually very chaotic.

Instead of spending blocks of time dedicated to working (I work from home), I'd
instead spend most of my day in reactionary mode: writing code that needed to be
built, handling customer email, working on various projects, having meetings,
etc.

Doing things the old way was partially good, and partially bad.  It was good in
that I had absolute freedom (most of the time) in terms of what I was doing at
any given moment.  It was bad in that I spent a lot of the time reacting to
things instead of getting things done.

Over the past few months I ended up working 12+ hours a day, as I never had any
sort of schedule, and instead of working for a few hours and stopping -- I'd
just continuously be working on things.  My default state was always *working*.

Unfortunately, while I've always known my practices weren't optimal, it wasn't
until these past few weeks that I realized just how bad things really were.

Since starting my new schedule, I've specifically moved all customer facing
things (phone calls, email, etc.) back until after my lunch break.  For the
first four hour block of time I spend working (~9:30am - 1:30pm), I
*exclusively* write code in little pomodoro blocks.

After lunch, where I have two more hours of work scheduled, I'm a bit more
flexible -- if there's anything important that needs to be done (non-coding
wise), then I'll do it (phone calls, etc.).

This change has been *profound*.

Instead of spending an enormous amount of time each day *responding* to work
events, I'm instead making a ridiculous amount of progress each morning without
interruption, and finishing an immense amount of work in really short blocks of
time.

At first, it was definitely hard to stay focused for a four hour block, but I've
found that with the right music and right pomodoro app on my phone, it's become
much easier (and more rewarding).

It's a great feeling to have lunch half way through the day knowing you've
already accomplished a ton of stuff.  My stress levels are lower, I feel
happier, and I'm getting way more done than I used to.

There's also something really relaxing about knowing that I don't even need to
keep a Gmail tab open in my browser until after lunch -- no alerts, no nothing.


### Free Time

After my six hours of work are up, I have free time until I go to bed.  Since
starting my new schedule, I've used this time for a variety of things.

I'd say that so far, about 50% of my *free time* has been spent continuing my
work on various things -- sometimes this means doing Google Hangouts with
co-workers, sometimes this means hacking on interesting bits of code, and
sometimes it just means reducing technical debt.

With the rest of my time, I've done a mix of different things:

- Go for a long bike ride with my wife.  We just got new bikes, so this is
  pretty high up on the list.
- Cook dinner and watch a movie.  This is really relaxing, especially after
  spending all day being productive.  Sometimes I just need to completely *zone
  out* for a couple of hours and recuperate on the couch.
- Spend time writing or reading.  Most of this article was written last night
  after work.
- Hacking on my side projects.

In the future, I'd like to shift things around such that after my six hours of
work are finished, I'm done for the day and will instead do other fun things.  I
think this would be a good way for me to avoid burning out in the long term, as
I spend a ton of time and energy working, and six hours of solid, focused work
seems like the upper limit of what I'm currently able to handle per day.


## Results

So far, I've really enjoyed my new schedule.  At this point in time, it's clear
that adhering to a strict schedule has greatly boosted my productivity,
increased my day to day happiness, and made me feel a lot more awesome.

The downsides so far have been that I've been more inaccessible to my wife, and
less flexible with free time -- but I think that over time, this will improve as
both of us will get used to the new schedule, and find better ways to maximize
our free time together.

So for now, the experiment has been a huge success.  I'll report back in the
next several weeks after my first month is finished up, and I'm able to better
evaluate the overall results.
