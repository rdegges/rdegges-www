![Thor Sketch][]


A couple of weeks ago, my friend [Alven][] and I built a small webapp together
that I wanted to share with you today: [motivation.io][].

The idea behind [motivation.io][] is simple: when I go workout at the gym and
lift weights, it requires a lot of effort and energy.  What I like to do before
I go to the gym is open [YouTube][], search for *bodybuilding motivation*, and
then watch a video or two to get myself pumped up for the gym.

While this has been working great for the past two years or so, it gets tedious
after a while.  It's hard to find fresh videos that are of decent quality, and
it adds an extra minute or two onto my daily pre-workout ritual.

[motivation.io][] solves this problem for me.  When you visit the site, it
randomly plays a high quality (hand selected) weight lifting video to get you
pumped up.  Want to watch a few?  No problem, after the current video ends
it'll load up another video random, for as long as you want.  As long as the
device you're on can play [YouTube][] videos, you should have no problem
getting it to work on your laptop, mobile phone, etc.

Anyhow, if you're into lifting weights, give [motivation.io][] a try and [let me
know what you think][]!
