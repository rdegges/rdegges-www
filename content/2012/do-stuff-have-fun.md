I've got a new philosophy--on life, work, adventures, whatever: do stuff, have
fun.

Even though I'm a very easy going fellow, I tend to spend a lot of time and
energy thinking about things and debating even the smallest decisions with
myself.  Over time, this bad habit has built up.  Yesterday I was debating with
myself about doing laundry.

LAUNDRY!

At the time, I was thinking something along the lines of: "Well, I really need
to do some laundry.  It's a lovely day outside, and it would be nice to get
outside on the patio and spend some time folding clothes anyway.  I should just
go for it."

But then my thinking really starts to kick in: "OH wait.  I really need to push
myself to finish this project I'm working on.  I've still got about 20 hours of
hacking left to do before I can even think about anything else.  And damn.  My
car!  I've got to call the shop back again tomorrow and let them know I'm
bringing it in.  Oh, but I've got to fill out that form on their website before
they'll call me back."

That's what flashed through my mind in only a millisecond or so.  I can't even
remember all the thousands of other things I was thinking immediately
afterwards--but the point is: it sucks.

I don't like making a big deal out of things so small and insignificant.  I
consider myself a reasonably logical and intelligent guy--but sometimes I just
think "WOA.  I really need to just let go of it all and do the things I want to
do."

If I want to go for a bike ride, I'm going to go for one!  If I want to spend
the next 3 hours working on that project that needs to get done, then I'll do
it, and I'll have fun with it.

I'm not going to let myself get carried away with the little things.  Life is
way too short for that.

From now on I'm just going to do stuff, and have fun.  Forget everything else.
