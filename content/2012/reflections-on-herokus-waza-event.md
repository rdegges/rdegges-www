Several days ago I was lucky enough to attend [Heroku's][] first conference,
[Waza][].  Waza is the Japanese word for art and technique, which, in
retrospect, was nothing short of the perfect name for the event.  In my life,
I've never attended such an artistic, well planned, and stylish event.


## Surprise!

If this isn't the first time you've visited my site, you probably know I
primarily write about technical stuff.  Over the past few months I've been
writing a lot about Heroku, which is, in my opinion, the best [Django][]
hosting platform available.

A few weeks back I got an email inviting me to Heroku's first conference, Waza,
which was going to be held on January 11th in San Francisco.

**Woa.**

I immediately accepted the invitation.  It's not every day you get to meet with
a group of the best programmers in the industry.  The guys who work at Heroku
are all top notch developers, and people.  If programming was illegal street
fighting, and I had to pick a partner to help me escape a
no-rules-street-fight, I would pick anyone from the Heroku team in a heartbeat.
:)

Anyhow, despite the fact that I can't imagine why anyone from Heroku would
invite me to their conference, I got in!


## Waza

Without a doubt, Waza was by far the nicest conference I've ever been to.  It
was nothing like a traditional tech conference.

The venue was particularly stunning.  The event was held at [Yoshi's][], a jazz
club in San Francisco.  Heroku essentially turned the entire inside of the
place into a Japanese village.  There were zen gardens, Japanese style eating
mats, amazing tea, and beautiful lighting throughout.  Entering the venue was a
lot like walking into a dream.  The entire place was beautiful, elegant, and
relaxing.

**NOTE**: I didn't get any pictures of the event, but [Kenneth Reitz][] got a
ton that totally kick ass.  I highly recommend checking out his
[Flickr album][].  If you look close, you'll find me :)

The event started at 11am with an excellent opening talk by Adam Wiggins, CTO
and co-founder of Heroku.  His talk was all about building excellent
applications: why elegance is important, what trends software development got
over the past decade, and what trends will become influential this decade.  His
talk primarily focused on application elegance, which I thought was a great
intro for the Waza conference, which focused on software development technique
and art more than anything else.

The talks were all amazing.  All were focused around building elegant
applications.  As a developer, I truly enjoyed the talks I got to attend.  They
were all inspiring, well executed, and filled with lots of useful information.


## People

By far the best part of the event was the people.  In particular, I got to
meet: [Craig Kerstiens][], [Kenneth Reitz][], [Curt Micol][], and
[Issac Kelly][].  Those guys are all programming superheroes.

I've known Craig, Kenneth and Issac online for a while, but meeting them in
person was really great.  If you guys are reading this: we should meet up again
soon!

As a complete surprise to me, I learned after arriving at Waza that
[Rob Pike][] was going to be giving the closing talk.  If you don't know Rob
Pike: he's one of the most influential programmers of all time.  He co-created
[UTF-8][] (unicode), created the [Go][] programming language, and made
countless contributions to UNIX.  He also wrote two excellent books that
contributed wildly to the programming profession:
[The Practice of Programming][], and [The UNIX Programming Environment][].
Without Rob Pike, the world would truly be a different place.

Seeing Rob in person was fucking awesome.  His talk was great, and it was
incredibly inspiring to even be in the same room as such an amazing guy.  As my
wife can attest, one of my lifelong dreams has been to meet
[Brian Kernighan][], [Dennis Ritchie][], and Rob Pike.  While I'll never be
able to meet Dennis (he passed away last year), I'm extremely happy to have had
the opportunity to meet Rob.


## Tea

![Green Tea Leaves][]

Oddly enough, other than an excellent group of techies--Waza had some amazing
vendors come to cater the event, one of which was [teance][], a Berkely tea
shop.  They were serving several types of fresh tea, all of which were
fabulous.

I've never been into tea much, but after a cup of teance's green tea, I was a
convert.  Best tea I've ever had in my life, hands down.

What made it even better was that the owner of the shop happened to be at the
event serving tea, and answered all sorts of crazy questions I had about the
tea.

After the event, my wife and I drove to the teance shop in Berkeley, and had tea
at their bar.  We tried several types of tea, and left with a couple hundred
dollars worth of the stuff.  Money well spent.

If you're into tea at all, you should definitely check out the [teance][] site
and order some.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.


## Overall

Waza was a great event.  The venue was great, the whole thing was comfortable
and relaxing, and there were tons of smart and interesting people all over the
place.  It was a great experience, and I had a ton of fun.

I hope the Heroku guys throw another one sometime soon.
