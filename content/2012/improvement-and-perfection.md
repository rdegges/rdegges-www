I just finished watching a truly excellent movie, [Jiro Dreams of Sushi][].  If
you haven't seen it, I'd highly recommend you watch it (it's available on
Netflix if you're a subscriber).

I'm all about motivational media, and *Jiro Dreams of Sushi* happens to be one
of the most motivating and happy films I've ever watched.  This article
contains my thoughts on improvement and perfection (the central theme of the
movie), since they are still fresh in my mind.

Everyone starts their lives with no skill.  As a child you know almost nothing.
Your parents and those around you gradually teach you how to live, how to act,
how to work, etc., but these skills are gained over time and with practice.

Nobody is born knowing how to write computer software, and nobody is born with
the ability to play guitar.  Every skill you possess is learned and acquired
over time, with lots of practice.  If you'd like to become better at playing
the guitar, you must deliberately practice playing the guitar--learning to read
music, learning the finger positions, learning how things are supposed to
sound, etc.  No matter how much you like guitar or how much you read about
guitar--the only way to get better at your craft is to deliberately practice
it.

The more you practice a certain skill, the better you'll become.  If you
continuously spend 10 hours a day making sushi, you willÂ undoubtedly become
better at making sushi.

In addition to practicing your craft, you can also improve your skill by
striving for perfection in your craft, and holding yourself to a high standard.
For instance--if you make sushi each day for 10 hours, this alone is not enough
to push you past a certain point of success.

To continue improving your sushi, you also need to strive for perfection.  You
need to pay close attention to each detail of the process.  You must perfect
the art of cooking the rice, slicing the fish, marinating the meats, and a
number of other things.

As you make sushi each day, you need to be strict with yourself.  You must
taste your sushi as it is being prepared to ensure it is up to your standards.
You must continue to experiment with your dishes and flavors to ensure they are
not only great, but as close to perfection as possible.

Each day you should practice your craft and strive for perfection, regardless
of whether you're preparing sushi or writing software.

I think this lesson holds true for all of life.  You should constantly push
yourself to be better than the day before.  Strive for perfection in every act
you perform.
