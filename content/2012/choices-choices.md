Something that is a constant source of inspiration for me, particularly in
difficult (or high stress) situations, is the knowledge that I have the ability
to make choices.

Everyday I wake up, and one of the first things I think about is what I'm going
to do that day.  Will I work hard?  Will I exercise?  Will I eat the right
foods?  Will I read?  Will I write?

It's so easy to not do any of those things.  It's incredibly easy to sit on the
couch, surf Reddit all day, and eat potato chips--and it's even easier to skip
the gym, leave the book on the bookshelf, and hide under the covers.

Every single day you have the ability (at any time) to decide what you're going
to do.  What you're doing right now is already in the past.  It doesn't matter
if you're currently slacking off on your diet, work, whatever--you have the
ability to stop what you're doing, and make another choice.

The beautiful thing about choices is that each choice you make moves you in a
new direction.  What if you decided (right now) that you wanted to be the best
bodybuilder in the world?  You could go lift some weights, get a gym
membership, read the necessary books, eat the necessary foods, train the
necessary ways--and, if you're persistent enough, you will do it.

Limitations are all imagined.  If you make the choices you want to make, and
consistently move forward to your goals--you *will* reach the outcome you're
looking for.

Don't let external factors hold you back.  If you want to do something, make
the choice to do it.
