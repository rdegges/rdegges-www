![Grim Reaper Writing Sketch][]

I can't believe it's been over two years since I last published an article here! Time really flies.

The crazy part is that over these last two years, I've done more writing than ever; it just hasn't been public.

Several years back, I started a [journaling habit][], and since then, most of my writing energy has been redirected from my website to my private journal.

While writing in private feels liberating, as I can dump every little thought in my head into an archive, I find myself missing the more structured and thought-out articles I used to push myself to publish.

There's something magical about writing down your thoughts and sharing them with the world, even if nobody sees them. It forces you to rethink your position, clarify your thoughts, and distill the mess in your head into something direct and actionable.

Over the last couple of years, I have missed that feeling, and the itch to continue writing has returned.

All this is simply to say that I'm writing again. The title of my website has always been "Random Thoughts of a Happy Programmer," so please stay tuned for more of my innermost thoughts and experiments.
