Exactly 1 month ago, I decided to try a new diet regime.  Over the past 7
months now I've been slowly losing weight, trying to get down to my goal weight
of 175lbs before doing some more serious bodybuilding type stuff.

Last month I decided to go on a strict ketogenic diet.  This basically involves
eating less than 30 grams of carbohydrates a day, which forces your metabolism
to break down fat tissue for energy instead of glucose in your blood stream.
Not consuming carbohydrates also helps to strictly control your insulin levels,
which spike up (allowing your body to store fat) when you consume carbs.

If you want to read more about ketosis, check out the [wikipedia article][] or
this [good summary][].


## First Month Results

For the past month I've been on a strict keto diet.  No cheat meals, nothing.
It was a lot easier than I thought it would be.  I didn't crave any sugary
foods for the last several weeks, and I've been feeling great the entire time.
Overall, I feel more energetic, and a lot more stable throughout the day.

When I weighed in exactly 1 month ago I was at exactly **244.0 lbs**.  This
morning I weighed in at exactly **227.2 lbs**.  Over the past month I've lost
**more than half a pound per day**!  This is a pretty insane amount of weight
loss considering how easy it was to lose the weight.

The other interesting thing to note is that this entire month, I've not
exercised as hard as I usually do, and I've also consumed way more calories
than I was previously.

Before last month, I was losing weight via calorie restriction (primarily), and
exercise.  I was doing high-intensity training 5 days a week, and running the
other days.  I was also eating around 1700 calories per day, average.

This month, I did only a single day of high intensity training.  2 weeks, I did
no exercise, and split amongst the other two weeks, I did biking several days of
the week.  My average caloric intake this month was around 2000 calories per
day.  I made it a point to eat until full almost every day in the month.


## Thoughts

I've really enjoyed maintaining ketosis for a solid month.  I've felt a lot
healthier, happier, and more energetic.  Eating fatty foods has been really
easy and tasty, I haven't missed carbs.  For now, my original plan remains: I'm
going to stay in ketosis until I reach 175 lbs, and then re-structure my diet
to reach my bodybuilding goals.

I'll post another update at the end of my second month, and hopefully be able
to share more interesting results!
