I think a lot about philosophy.  One specific area that fascinates me more and
more is personal development and achievement.  How do people achieve greatness?
What drives them?  What separates amazing performance from standard
performance, and why is it that some people are able to reach such
unprecedented levels of success?

In my quest to continually learn more about this phenomena, I've read numerous
books and blogs on the subject.  Some of the greater ones have been (in no
particular order):

-   [Talent Is Overrated][]
-   [Sebastian Marshall][]
-   [Do the Work][]
-   [My Life][]
-   [Hackers & Painters][]
-   [The Power of Less][]

And this is just to name *a few*.  In the past 6 months alone, I've read well
over 20 books on the topic, searching for answers and similarities between
them.  I suppose you could say that my quest for knowledge has become a bit of
an obsession.

What I've come to believe after so much research is that the root of all change
is **consistency**.  I've discussed this before, in various other articles and
various other manners--but at the core of all change lies consistency.  Let me
explain.

In order to achieve your goals, whatever they may be, you need to change
something about yourself.  Let's say you want to become the strongest man in
the world, you'll need to change your diet, training, schedule, and many other
self traits.  But this is not enough on its own.  Even if you change your
training schedule, it brings you no closer to your goal if you don't
*consistently* execute it.

The only way that true change can be manifested is through *consistent* effort,
over and over again.  In the book, [Talent Is Overrated][], the author
describes several scientific studies which track musicians for long periods of
time.  Without exception, the best players are the ones who *consistently*
practice playing over and over again, longer than their peers.

The conclusion the study comes to is that talent (as we know it) is
nonexistent.  The only thing that separates amazing performers from standard or
sub-par performers is the amount of effort (e.g. *consistency*) they put into
it.  Study after study referenced in the book draws the same conclusions.  The
most successful, powerful, and top-performers in their fields always have one
thing in common: *consistency*.

So what does this mean for us?  I know that for me, it means that in order to
achieve the goals I've set for myself, and to develop into the person I someday
hope to become, I need to continuously make small changes in my daily life, and
*consistently* execute them, day after day.  Of course, *consistency* is not
easy to achieve.  It requires willpower, motivation, and desire.  If you've
ever tried to start a new exercise or diet regiment, you likely know what I'm
talking about.  It can be really, REALLY hard to make the right choices every
day.  For me, everyday is a battle to continue improving, bit by bit.

When I started making my own life changes, I decided to look for ways to get
help building *consistency* into my daily routine.  The best tool I found was
[HabitForge][] (check it out).  HabitForge is a great web app that helps you
build *consistency*Â through habits.  Their approach is this: you create a new
habit (exercise 30 minutes a day, read for 30 minutes a day, write 1 page of
text each day, etc.), and if you *consistently* execute this habit for 21 days
in a row, then you'll have overcome the psychological hardships associated with
starting a new habit (life change).  HabitForge emails you every day, asking if
you completed your daily habit, and requests your input (in yes/no format).  If
you answer no to any of the daily emails, then your completion counter resets
to 1 (out of 21), and you've got to *consistently* execute your habit for
another 20 days in a row in order to engrain it into your person.

The way HabitForge helps you develop *consistency* in whatever you want to do
is by providing you with extra motivation: you want to see that completion
counter show that you've "mastered" a habit--so you are less likely to avoid
your task and more likely to complete it every day in a *consistent* fashion.

I've been using HabitForge for months now, and it's been a great tool.  I've
used it to:

-   Lose 80lbs.
-   Read for 30 minutes a day.
-   Exercise 6 days a week.
-   Adjust my sleep schedule.
-   And other things I won't get into here.

As I continue working towards my goals, I try to constantly remind myself that
*consistency* is key.  Even when you don't feel like putting in the time
towards your daily goal--do it anyway, it adds up over time.  And that is the
core way to make change.  *Consistency*.
