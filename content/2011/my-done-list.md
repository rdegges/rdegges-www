I really enjoy thinking and writing about programming.  Since I started writing
code years ago, I've been obsessed with code quality and best practices--and I
think it's safe to say that a lot of hackers out there feel the same.

I'm pretty sure my urge to write excellent code is driven by some innate desire
to perfect everything; regardless, I stopped trying to fight it long ago, and
started embracing it.

**DISCLAIMER**: what I'm about to discuss is stupidly obvious.  I actually feel
quite stupid writing this; however, since this has made such a large impact on
my code quality and programming mentality, I figured I would share it despite
my shame.


## Have a "Done" List

One of the greatest productivity tricks I've learned has been this: *always
have a "done" list*.

A "done" list is checklist that you use as a personal binding contract.  Having
a "done" list means making a commitment to yourself that each time you touch a
piece of code, you don't consider it "done" until you've completely gone
through your checklist.

For instance, my "done" list is:

-   Purpose of what I'm doing is logged in some form of tracking system
    ([GitHub][] Issues, [sprintly][], etc.).
-   Tests are written.
-   Code implemented.
-   Tests pass.
-   Code review.
-   Documentation written.
-   Deployed.

If that means it takes a while longer to code, then so be it.  A "done" list is
a simple way to hold yourself to a high development standard, and consistently
write quality code.

I've found that even when I'm not able to consistently go through my "done"
list every time I touch code--through the process of trying to meet each of my
"done" requirements, I write much better code than I would otherwise.
