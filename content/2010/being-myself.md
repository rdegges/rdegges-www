![Reaper Sketch][]


I've been thinking a lot about my life lately.  Maybe it's because the new year
is almost here, or maybe it is because I've been having a lot of weird "grown
up" life experiences.

These past couple years (I left uni ~2.5 years ago) have been the best in my
life.  I learned what the real world was like, what I suck at, what I'm good
at, and what makes me happy. A few weeks ago I learned what type of person I
really am (I'm a hippie), and have been slowly coming to terms with myself.

Up until now, I haven't really been myself.  I've made a lot of mistakes.
Among other things, I've:

-   Not stood up for what I believe in.
-   Lied to myself.
-   Tried to make everyone happy.
-   Hidden my true intentions and thoughts from friends and strangers.
-   Cared too much about what other people think, instead of myself.
-   Been too self conscious about myself.
-   Not done things because it seemed 'too crazy'.
-   Been afraid to take risks.
-   Allowed myself to be uptight and stressed.

Life is short.  Really short.  From now on I'm going to forget about other
people, and do what I think is right.  I'm going to take risks, have fun, and
enjoy my life as much as I can.

So, I'd like to introduce you to the new Randall.  Here are a few facts about
me (that you may not know):

-   I love puns.  Seriously.  I like a ton of lame jokes.
-   I like hip-hop, reggae, pop, and rock music.
-   I hate pants, and all formal wear.  The only stuff I like wearing are
    shorts, t-shirts, and sandals.
-   I love reading tech books.  I'm not that big on fiction.  They're fun!
-   I'm a total hippie.  I'm super liberal.
-   I like to use unnecessary adjectives (e.g. 'super', 'awesome', etc.).
-   I like (parenthesis).
-   I hate the US government.
-   I'm an atheist.  Pro abortion.  Pro gay marriage.
-   I'm spontaneous.  I like driving to the beach at midnight and going to far
    away places on a whim.
-   I'm a minimalist.
-   I want everyone to be awesome to each other.
-   I'm not very social, but I want to be.
-   Ideally, I'd like to live on (or near) the beach, and listen to some loud
    tunes while coding all day and night.
-   I want to leave LA, and move to Northern California, Hawaii, or another
    country.

I'm going to start living the way I want to, and keeping it real.  If you wanna
hang out, [send me an email][]!
