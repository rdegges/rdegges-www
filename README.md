My personal website: https://www.rdegges.com


## Development

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast static site generator.

```bash
# Install Hugo (https://gohugo.io/installation/)
brew install hugo

# Run locally with live reload
hugo server

# Build for production
hugo
```


## Theme

I've built my own custom theme here for my personal usage — feel free to take
from it what you want. I release it into the public domain.
